# SpringBoot-Project
This is the basic spring-boot project made in spring tool suite ide integrated with maven. Besides this, java1.8 version is used. Front-end is done with the help of JSP.
here I have used h2 database for the management of data. Spring boot helps to reduce writing xml configuration, and writing boilerplate code.
